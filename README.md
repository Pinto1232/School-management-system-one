# School Management System

## Description
The School Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline administrative tasks and improve communication between administrators, teachers, students, and parents. It provides features such as user authentication, dashboard insights, student and teacher management, and more.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration for administrators, teachers, students, and parents.
- **Dashboard Insights:** Real-time insights and analytics for better decision-making.
- **Student Management:** Manage student profiles, academic records, attendance, and more.
- **Teacher Management:** Manage teacher profiles, schedules, and performance.
- **Parent Portal:** Allow parents to track their child's academic progress and communicate with teachers.
- **Communication Tools:** Built-in messaging and notification system for seamless communication.

## Installation
To install and set up the School Management System on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)
- MongoDB (v4.x or later)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Pinto1232/School-management-system-one.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd School-management-system-one
   ```

3. **Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:**
   ```sh
   cd backend
   npm install
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up the environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
   - Add necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection details, API keys):
     ```
     MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/school_management
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     ```

5. **Start the development servers:**
   - **Backend:**
     ```sh
     cd backend
     npm start
     ```
   - **Frontend:**
     ```sh
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```

## Usage
Once the School Management System is set up, you can access it through your web browser. Use the provided login credentials to sign in as an administrator, teacher, or student, depending on your role. Explore the dashboard, manage student and teacher profiles, track attendance, and utilize other features as needed.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

### Frontend
- **Technologies Used:**
  - React.js for building the user interface.
  - Redux for state management.
  - Vite for frontend tooling.
  - Material-UI for UI components.

- **Directory Structure:**
  - `src`: Contains the main source code for the frontend.
    - `components`: Reusable React components.
    - `pages`: Different pages of the application.
    - `redux`: Redux store and slices.
    - `hooks`: Custom hooks.
    - `utils`: Utility functions.
    - `assets`: Static assets like images and styles.

### Backend
- **Technologies Used:**
  - Node.js for server-side logic.
  - Express.js for handling routes and middleware.
  - MongoDB for database storage.
  - Swagger for API documentation.

- **Directory Structure:**
  - `src`: Contains the main source code for the backend.
    - `config`: Configuration files.
    - `controllers`: Controllers for handling requests.
    - `models`: MongoDB models.
    - `routes`: API routes.
    - `middlewares`: Custom middleware functions.
    - `utils`: Utility functions.

## Architectural Choices
- **Separation of Concerns:** The project is divided into frontend and backend to separate the user interface from the server-side logic.
- **React and Redux:** React is used for building the user interface, and Redux is used for state management to ensure a predictable state container.
- **Express and MongoDB:** Express is used for building the RESTful API, and MongoDB is used as the database for storing application data.
- **Material-UI:** Material-UI is used for building a modern and responsive user interface with pre-built components.

## Core Requirements and Approach
- **User Authentication:** Implemented secure login and registration using JWT for token-based authentication.
- **Dashboard Insights:** Developed real-time dashboards using React and Redux to provide insights and analytics.
- **Student and Teacher Management:** Created CRUD operations for managing student and teacher profiles, academic records, and attendance.
- **Parent Portal:** Built a parent portal to allow parents to track their child's progress and communicate with teachers.
- **Communication Tools:** Integrated messaging and notification systems for seamless communication between users.

## Challenges Faced
- **State Management:** Managing the state across different components and ensuring data consistency was challenging. Redux helped in maintaining a predictable state container.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the application is fully responsive and works well on different devices required careful planning and testing.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data was crucial.
- **Database Design:** Designing a scalable and efficient database schema to handle various entities and relationships was challenging.
